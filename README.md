The code will then start up the JetBot robot and allow you to control it using the keyboard. You can use the arrow keys to move the robot around, and the space bar to toggle between autonomous and manual mode.

In autonomous mode, the robot will use its object detection network to avoid obstacles and navigate around the environment. In manual mode, you can control the robot's movement directly using the keyboard.
